Gomoku Game
******************************
Description
This project implements a Gomoku game (five in a row) using Java FX. The user can select from 3 modes, player vs player, player vs smart computer and player vs random player. The player always takes first turn to move and followed by either another player or computer. The computer player adopts two types of strategies, the random strategy that finds random unoccupied position on game board and a smart computer player strategy using Minimax algorithm combined with Alpha Beta prunning to optimize the speed. When a winner is found, the game will declare the winner and prompt the user to start a new game.


******************************
Work Breakdown
Chuyang worked on the random player and aiplayer strategy.
Paula worked on the game board and MVC pattern.


******************************
Interfaces
There are 2 interfaces in this project.
1. PlayerInterface: This interface allows for different types of players. AIPlayer and RandomPlayer are implemented in this project.
2. Strategy: This class allows for different strategies to play the gomoku game. Mini-Max with Alpha-Beta strategy and Random strategy are implemented in this project.


******************************
Design Pattern
This project uses the MVC patter to seperate out the user interface with the back end calculation. 
Model: The board class serves as the model in this project. It keeps track of the current state of game and is independent of the viewer class
Viewer: The viewer class draws the board on the user interface. It's draw box function takes in a board object as parameter and draws the object. The class does not depend on the model. 
Controller: The GameController class serves as the communicator between the Board class and the Viewer class. It contains a board object and a viewer object and controls the game flow. It updates the game board and calls the view to draw out the game board in each turn. 


******************************
Data Structures
We mainly used linear data structure, including link list, array lists and queues in this project.


******************************
Advanced Topics 
We used JavaFX as the user interface to draw out the game board. The interface receives mouse click interaction from the user and updates the game board accordingly. 


******************************
Program Instruction
You should go to the GomokuGame class and run the game. The program will let user to select a game mode and start the game after that.
